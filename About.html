<h1>My Story</h1>
<p>Hey, I'm Anders.
   I was born and raised in Denmark, more specically in the city of Arhus. 
   I spent my first 23 years of my life in Denmark until I met my now wife. 
   My wife was part of a study abroad project through the University of Oklahoma. 
   We met at my University and when it was time for her to go back to the States, we decided that I should move to Oklahoma with her and finish my Bachelors degree at her University. And the rest is history</p>
